                        Hi! Welcome to the personal&nbsp;website of&nbsp;David Sangojinmi.

                    <h2>Who?</h2>
                    <p>
                        My name is David Sangojinmi. I am a young aspiring developer. Since a very young age I have always been interested in IT, computing and technology as well as how the things we see around us really work. This interest has only grown and when I was 13 I decided I would start learning programming languages and how things work.
                        <br><br>
                        As of now I have learnt and am able to program in HTML and CSS. You can find some of my projects on another page in the website. The languages I am currently learning are: Python, Java and PHP. In addition I am learning how to create responsive websites and use command line programs.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>What?</h2>
                    <p>
                        This website is both a personal website for me, and a hub. If you search up the meaning of the word "hub" on Google, you will find two main definitions. the first is:
                        <br><br>&nbsp;<b style="color: #f00">1</b>&nbsp; the central part of a wheel, rotating on or with the axle, and from which the spokes radiate
                        <br><br>&nbsp;<b style="color: #f00">2</b>&nbsp; the effective centre of an activity, region, or network
                        <br><br>The one that applies to this website is the second one, the effective centre of an activity, region, or network. I intend for this website to be a centre, a core for my prgramming experience. Whilst I am learning languages such as Java or Python I make little projects. I'm sure many other programmers do this as well. They help develop the previous knowledge gained and are a good way to test understanding of specific parts or general parts of the languages being learnt. If these projects are successful I will upload them to the projects part of the website for me to reflect upon them and anyone who visits my website to see. This is a more useful alternative to just creating projects and never uploading them to any platform.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Why?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I created this website to test and showcase my skills with the programming languages HTML and CSS. I have made small projects before but I decided making a website that is hosted online would be a good way to test my skills. Due to the website being online and live there are certain standards I must take into consideration such as Alt data and Meta Tags. Things like colour contrasts and making sure you have good code. All these things are important when you are creating something other people may possibly use and not just small scale projects for fun.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>How?</h2>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned before this website was created using HTML and CSS. Those are the programming languages used for the programming part of building this website. This website is hosted using &nbsp;<a class="plink" href="https://github.com">Github Pages</a>&nbsp;, this is a free way to host your work and projects online. Other hosting services are good however if you do not want to pay to host your work, or can't then Github Pages is very useful. Due to their service being free there may be certain restrictions or limitations however it is still a good way to start.
                        <br><br>
                        Text editors and compilers are very useful when coding. They allow you to write, change, edit and save code. There are many text editors out there but the ones that I prefer are:
                        <br><br>- <a class="plink" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>
                        <br><br>- <a class="plink" href="https://atom.io">Atom.io</a>
                        <br><br>- <a class="plink" href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>
                        <br><br>
                        All of these text editors have specific features which make them very useful and stand out.
